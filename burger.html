    <img src="burger.jpg" width="200">
    <p>A burger is a popular sandwich featuring a cooked patty (usually ground beef, but can be turkey, veggie, etc.) nestled in a sliced bun, often with toppings like cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, and condiments such as ketchup or mayo, creating a savory, handheld meal popular globally as fast food and in gourmet settings.</p>
    <p>A basic burger includes a cooked meat patty (usually beef) in a sliced bun, topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayo; cheese is a common addition (cheeseburger). Patty ingredients often add flavor and binding, with ground beef, salt, pepper, sometimes egg, breadcrumbs, or Worcestershire sauce.</p>
