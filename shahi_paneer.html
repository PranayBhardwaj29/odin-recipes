    <p>Shahi Paneer features paneer in a rich, creamy gravy of tomatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, and cashews, flavored with aromatic whole spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, cumin) and powdered spices (coriander, red chili, turmeric, garam masala), finished with fresh cream and kasuri methi for a royal taste. Key ingredients include paneer, tomatoes, onions, cashews, cream, ghee/butter, ginger-garlic paste, and a blend of spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and Kashmiri red chili. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes, puréed</li>
        <li>8 ounces paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until onion soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Season with cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add puréed tomatoes to the skillet; cook until excess liquid evaporates and oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add paneer, water, sugar, and salt; stir gently so paneer does not break apart.
